Hello, I hope you enjoyed browsing through the files. The running order should be fairly straightforward. 
Here is an unorganised "wish list" of things I would like to work on to make this project (even) better.

1) Determining the impacts of grid connection costs and how these vary regionally 
2) Expand the data sources to include IEA (?) and expand the geographical reach of this project
3) Include a greater number of technologies and fuels, not only intermittent renewables 
4) Web/Shiny interface??

  
All additional comments/suggestions/critiques welcome! Comment on the GitHub or email me.
